To use the ComputerVision.py ensure both it and the imports.py file are in the directory required

Then import it using the following:

from ComputerVision import analyseImage

Afterwards you can use it by calling the function and assigning the results to a variable
The variable will be an instance of the analysedImage class.
To access the variable use the "." operator on the variable.
Below is an example:

imageResults = analyseImage(imageURL)
print(f"Logggg: {imageResults.logCount}")
print(f"Licenseeee: {imageResults.licensePlate}")
